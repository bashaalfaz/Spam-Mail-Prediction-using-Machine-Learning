# 📧 Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a **Spam Mail Prediction System** built with **Python and Machine Learning**.  
It classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using **Logistic Regression** after processing text with **TF-IDF Vectorization**.  
A simple **web interface** is provided so users can input email text and get real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of email text (stopword removal, lowercasing, tokenization)
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- Machine Learning model: **Logistic Regression**
- Achieved **~96% accuracy** on test dataset
- Deployed as a **Web App** (Streamlit/Flask)
